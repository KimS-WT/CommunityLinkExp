The name will be changed on Friday when we have our meeting on the name. The most popular one appears to be Community Link.

Setup:

Ensure you have the latest version of .NET
run dotnet --version to see. If you don't have version 8 get it <a src="dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0">here</a>:

dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

With that, I got it to work on my secondary device. If you have any problems running and pushing to the repository, please let me know!
