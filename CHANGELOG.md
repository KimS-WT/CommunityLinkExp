## [0.2.7] - 2024-7-20
 - This is a New Version of the project for experimentation 

### Notes
 - I have changed several files and styles, the backend and things related to the database were untoched
 - For Example: Sign In page "layout" was unaffected only the navbar layout and html background color were affected.

### Changed
 - consolidated site.css for brevity clarity and functionality
 - consolidated _layout.chtml.css for brevity clarity and functionality
 - overall these changes result in better use of bootstrap and ef-core
  - bootstrap is a grid system, and efcore can display info from the database, (think tables, rows, columns)
 - implemented navbar with dropdown and search

### Next Steps
 - continue correcting bootstrap and css layout and style
  - fix the responsiveness of the rows 
   - About Page
   - Donate Page
  - Events dropdown text and arrow needs to be darker
  - Research how to make scroll for navbar collapsed
  - Research Modals and how to style
